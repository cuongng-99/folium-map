Hereâ€™s the corrected version:

#### **1. About the Data**

- This dataset contains a list of orders from an e-commerce company in Hanoi.
- Dimensions include: OrderId, Address, Revenue.

=> This data has been transformed to suit personal purposes.

#### **2. Idea**

- I will create a Python map to show the addresses and distribution of customers.
- To do this, I will collect additional data about the population for each ward and also obtain geocoding information.

#### **3. Action**

- **3.1 Import Libraries**
- **3.2 Data Processing:**
  - Standardize the names of wards/districts.
  - Summarize dimensions such as revenue and order quantity by ward/district.
- **3.3 Draw Map**

  - Here, my source code uses nbviewer to display an interactive map:
    [nbviewer link](https://nbviewer.org/github/cuongng-99/folium-map/blob/master/main.ipynb)

    => From the drawn map, we will have a visual overview of the distribution of revenue and the number of orders in different areas, as well as additional information about population and population density. This will help assess potential locations for selecting store sites.
